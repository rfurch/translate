# translate
C code to use Google translate API and local cache 


// this code takes advantage of FREE google translationservices
// presented via URI:
// https://translate.googleapis.com/translate_a/single?client=gtx&sl=es&tl=en&dt=t&q=esot%es%una%prueba";
// altough the basic routines are the same that we can use in google business platform (we need to pay for 
// the service) in which a KEY is assigned. 
// the parsing procedures are similar (URI encode and JSON coding)
